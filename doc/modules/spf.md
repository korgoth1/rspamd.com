# SPF module

SPF module performs checks of the sender's [SPF](http://www.openspf.org/) policy.
Many mail providers uses SPF records to define which hosts are eligible to send email
for this specific domain. In fact, there are many possibilities to create and use
SPF records, however, all they check merely the sender's domain and the sender's IP.

The specific case are automated messages from the special mailer daemon address:
`<>`. In this case Rspamd uses `HELO` to grab domain information as specified in the
standard.

## Principles of work

`SPF` can be a powerful tool when properly used. However, it is very fragile in many
cases: when a message is somehow redirected or reconstructed by mailing lists software.

Moreover, many mail providers have no clear understanding of this technology and
misuse the SPF technique. Hence, the scores for SPF symbols are relatively small
in Rspamd.

SPF uses DNS service extensively, therefore Rspamd maintain the cache of SPF records.
This cache operates on principle of `least recently used` expiration. All cached item
lifetimes are accordingly limited by the matching DNS record time to live.

You can manually specify the size and max expire of this cache by configuring SPF module.
In addition, you can to assign some parameters such as maximum number of recursive DNS subrequests (e.g. includes chain
length), maximum count of DNS requests per record, minimum TTL enforced for all elements in SPF records, disable all IPv6
lookups and specify an IP addresses for which the SPF check will not be used.

~~~ucl
# local.d/spf.conf

	spf_cache_size = 1k; # cache up to 1000 of the most recent SPF records
	spf_cache_expire = 1d; # default max expire for an element in this cache
	max_dns_nesting = 10; # maximum number of recursive DNS subrequests
	max_dns_requests = 30; # maximum count of DNS requests per record
	min_cache_ttl = 5m; # minimum TTL enforced for all elements in SPF records
	disable_ipv6 = false; # disable all IPv6 lookups
	whitelist = "/path/to/some/file"; # whitelist IPs from checks
~~~

You can do it by adding an IP address (or multiple addresses) to the configuration file directly or using an external map.
Should you place the IP address or addresses in the configuration file directly then please remember to use an array of string
representing the desired addresses even if you add a single IP address, e.g. ['192.168.1.1']. You can use networks in CIDR
notation instead of IP addresses as well.

~~~ucl
# local.d/spf.conf

	external_relay = ["192.168.1.1"]; # use IP address from a received header produced by this relay (using by attribute)
~~~

~~~ucl
# local.d/spf.conf

	external_relay = "/path/to/ip.map";
~~~

For example, in mail's header below, Rspamd will check SPF policy for IP 77.77.77.77, provided that IP 192.168.1.1 was
specified as external relay by configuring SPF module.

~~~ucl

Currently, Rspamd supports the full set of SPF elements, macros and has internal
protection from DNS recursion.
